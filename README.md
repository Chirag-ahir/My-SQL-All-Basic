 What is SQL Joins ?<br>
 A SQL JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.<br>
 
>INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables<br> 
 
>LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table<br>
