What is Table ?<br>
A table is a Database object that is composed of rows and columns and contains related data. 

What is Field ?<br>
A field is a column in a table that is supposed to provide specific information about all the records in the table. 

What is a Record ?<br>
A record is a row in a table. It is also known as a Horizontal entity of a table.

What is Null value ?<br>
A null is neither an empty string nor a zero value.

What is Data ?<br>
Data is defined as facts or figures, or information that's stored in or used by a computer.

What is DataType?<br>
A DataType is a property that specifies the type of data you can put in your table.

What is Database ?<br>
Database is a storage system that has a collection of data. 

What is SQL ? <br>
SQL stands for ‘Structured Query Language’. It is the most common programming language used for executing queries, and handling data by using CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operation on a Relational Database Management System (RDMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL.

What is MySQL ?<br>
MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL).

What is MySQL Aliases ? <br>
Aliases in MySQL is used to give a temporary name to a table or a column in a table for the purpose of a particular query.

What is the difference between DROP and TRUNCATE ?<br>
DROP command is used to remove the whole database or table. Whereas the TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the rows from the table.

what is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE ?<BR>
 The DELETE command in SQL removes one or more rows from a table based on the conditions specified in those rows whereas TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the rows from the table whether or not any conditions are met. 
 
 > Ex of DELETE : delete from students where id = 1;<BR>
 
 > Ex of TRUNCATE : truncate table students; <br>
 
 >Ex of DROP : drop table students; 
 
What is DDL commands ?<br>
DDL commands are used to define the structure of the database, table, schemas, etc. It enables us to perform the operations like CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, and TRUNCATE schema objects.

What is DML commands ?<br>
DML commands are used to make changes in the database, such as: CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete data. Using the INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and Delete commands.
 
What is Constraints in SQL ?<br>
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 

>NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
 
>UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
 
>PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each row in a table
 
>FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
 
>CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
 
>DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
 
>CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

 
 
What is Stored Procedure ? <br>
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

What is the diference between Primary key and Foreign key?
A primary key generally focuses on the uniqueness of the table. It assures the value in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is generally used to build a relationship between the two tables. Table allows only one primary key.
 
 What is SQL Joins ?<br>
 A SQL JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.<br>
 
>INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables<br> 
 
>LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table<br>
 
>RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table<br>
 
>CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables<br>
